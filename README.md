# LHPaperErnstEtAl
Repository for all public code relating to this paper.

This is the repository for all code relating to this paper that I am allowed to share.

There are some files ("The Eddy Tracking Steps") which I am not allowed to share on account of them not being my code.
(Those particular snippets were more or less leased by the lab, not me.)
See the text of the paper for the different authors you may accost for their specific code that interfaces with mine.
Notably, Pegliasco et al. (2015), whose algorithm we use and improve upon.

The organization is as such: besides the readme, every piece of code here is a .m file or a .mat file. 

Files related to specific figures will be annotated as such. .mat files associated with specific figures will be placed in their respective folders.

When all is said and done, you should be able to replicate all this work easily.

Everything here done on MATLAB2021b. Check for version dependencies.
